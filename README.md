# Bootstrap Basics Knowledge Check

This is my Bootstrap project that I created to demonstrate my understanding of Bootstrap fundamentals. I built a complete webpage that shows off different Bootstrap components and features.

## What I Built

I created a webpage with 5 main sections:

### 1. Registration Form
I made a user registration form using Bootstrap's form components. The First Name and Last Name fields are positioned side-by-side using Bootstrap's grid system. I added validation to make sure the Email and Password fields are required, and styled the submit button with Bootstrap's success theme.

### 2. Data Table
I built a table to display user data with Bootstrap styling. The table has striped rows and hover effects to make it easier to read. I used a dark header and made sure it's responsive for mobile devices. I added some sample user data to show how it looks.

### 3. Image Gallery
I added two images to demonstrate Bootstrap's image utilities. The main image uses the `img-fluid` class and stretches across the full width of the page. Below that, I added a circular profile image using the `rounded-circle` class. I used my own images (`largeImg.jpg` and `smallImg.jpg`) instead of placeholder images.

### 4. Button Examples
I created two buttons to show Bootstrap's display utilities. One button is always visible, and the other is hidden on small screens using the `d-none d-md-inline-block` classes. This demonstrates how Bootstrap handles responsive design.

### 5. Navigation Bar
I built a responsive navigation bar with a dark theme. It collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens and includes links to Home, About, and Contact sections.

## Files in This Project

## How to Use This Project

1. Download or clone the project files
2. Open `bootstrap.html` in your web browser
3. Try resizing your browser window to see how the page responds
4. Test the form validation and navigation menu
